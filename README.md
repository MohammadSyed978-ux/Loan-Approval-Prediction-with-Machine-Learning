## Project Name - Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning ##


This project uses machine learning to automate loan eligibility predictions based on customer application data. I built an end-to-end classification pipeline in Python that includes data cleaning, 
handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing numerical variables for modeling. After performing exploratory data analysis to understand how factors such as credit history, 
income, education, and marital status influence loan approval, I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using scikit-learn. The model learns decision boundaries from historical loan data to 
classify applicants as approved or not approved, and its performance was evaluated using training and test accuracy. This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning for 
real-time, data-driven decision-making in financial and insurance use cases.
